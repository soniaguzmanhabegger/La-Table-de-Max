# La Table de Max

## üöÄ Power BI Project

This report is designed to demonstrate skills in:
- Data preparation 
- Data modeling and analysis
- Data visualization and storytelling
- Creating interactive, professional dashboards
- Transforming complex data into actionable insights 


### Project Title One
This report is based on fictional data generated in ChatGPT. The command was to generate 7 months data of sales and menu items for 3 restaurants in France. Since I want to analyze sales performance by time of day and day of the week, transaction dates were prompted as well.

This report was created in Power BI as an infographic to convey the insights directly into the report, in structured sections, and with customer experience in sight.
